# 1.9.2

.NET Core came a step closer to completion With the [announcement of the release of RC2](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2016/05/16/announcing-asp-net-core-rc2/). The new releases of Logging, Dependecy Injection and Configuration had a few breaking changes was handled. `RawRabbit` is now fully migrated to the new project structure. There are [new sample projects](https://github.com/pardahlman/RawRabbit/tree/master/sample) that combines .NET Core with RawRabbit (including Attributed Routing, Message Sequence etc.) and Serilog.

The underlying dependecy `RabbitMQ.Client` was updated, as it  [ 3.6.2 was released earlier this week](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rabbitmq-users/KCtezCXs1l8). While at it, all other NuGet dependencies was updated to its latest version.

# 1.9.0

In this minor release, a breaking change in topology features in introduced, namely the default type for exchanges is `Topic` rather than `Direct`. Read through the [client upgrade](http://rawrabbit.readthedocs.org/en/master/client-upgrade.html) page for more information.

Thanks to [videege](https://github.com/videege), there is now a package for Ninject. We've also added logging adapters for the major logging frameworks (Serilog, NLog and log4net).

# 1.8.12

In this release, the `ChannelFactory` has been rewritten from the ground up. The old channel factory is left intact, but called `ThreadBasedChannelFactory`. One of the sync methods in the `IChannelFactory` interface is removed. It is recommended to use the async methods. All operations now use the new `ITopologyProvider` for creating topology features.

Commits: 8b627ae192...c6f928addf


# 1.8.8

The first step in a refactoring has been taken. The aim is to increase thoughput by using async methods and allowing for multiple threads to publish messages.

Also, a new NuGet package, [`RawRabbit.DependencyInjection.Autofac`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RawRabbit.DependencyInjection.Autofac) has been created.

Commits: 8b627ae192...13b86c7bf6


# 1.8.7

In this release the `ConnectionStringParser` has been polished by [Originalutter](https://github.com/Originalutter). It now supports all configuration parameters available in the configuration object. There are also some nice default values, like port `5672` which can be omitted from connection string.

An `KeyNotFound` issue  that sometimes occurred when performing multiple request synchronous (with `await`) was fixed.
